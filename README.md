 # React Task-Tracker
The main purpose of this project was to capture data from forms and use this data with states in single page. Adjusting the color according to the changing states, highlighting the completed tasks bonus information.
+ useState, 
+ defaultProp, 
+ React-icons, 
+ Map, <br> are the methods I generally use in this project.
